missionTitle: "Our mission"
missionIntro: "We believe every garment has a story worth telling. Our mission is to bring radical transparency to the textile supply chain in Latin America through Digital Product Passports — giving consumers, brands, and regulators a clear view of a product's journey from fiber to finished piece."
missionBody: "As the EU Digital Product Passport regulation reshapes global trade, Latin American textile producers face both a challenge and an opportunity. Textile Trace Latam bridges that gap by providing an accessible, standards-compliant DPP platform tailored to the needs and realities of the region's supply chains. We work directly with producers, manufacturers, and brands to capture verified data at every step — composition, environmental impact, labor conditions, and certifications."
